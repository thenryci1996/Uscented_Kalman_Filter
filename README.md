# Unscented Kalman Filter #
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Implementation of an Unscented Kalman Filter using data and skeleton from Udacity Github ##


### Highlights ###
* Sensor Fusion with lidar and radar data
* Constant Turn Rate and Velocity Magnitude Model
* Eigen library and cmake

### Results ###

* The output is the root square mean error 
* The visualization.py helps to see the estimate of Kalman filter, the measurements and the ground truth
* The linear acceleration and the yaw rate acceleration noises are chosen w.r.t to the NIS values.
